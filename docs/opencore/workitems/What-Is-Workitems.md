### Workitems

Work items represent a unit of work. It has a name, a next run timestamp and it can contain a payload ( json ) and one or more files. 
You start by creating a Workitem Queue that defines the rules for items inside it, and logic for "triggering" other parts of the system to start processing the items with in it.
